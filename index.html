          Lviv is the largest city in Western Ukraine, and the sixth-largest 
          in Ukraine, with a population of 717,510 (2021 est.) Lviv is one 
          of the main cultural centres of Ukraine. It was named in honour of 
          Leo, the eldest son of Daniel, King of Ruthenia.

          Lviv emerged as the centre of the historical regions of Red Ruthenia 
          and Galicia in the 14th century, superseding Halych, Chełm, Belz and 
          Przemyśl. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia 
          from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King Casimir III the Great 
          of Poland. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the Ruthenian 
          Voivodeship in the Kingdom of Poland. In 1772, after the First Partition 
          of Poland, the city became the capital of the Habsburg Kingdom of Galicia 
          and Lodomeria. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the West 
          Ukrainian People's Republic. Between the wars, the city was the centre of 
          the Lwów Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic. After the German-Soviet 
          invasion of Poland in 1939, Lviv became part of the Soviet Union, and in 
          1944–46 there was a population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine. 
          In 1991, it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.
